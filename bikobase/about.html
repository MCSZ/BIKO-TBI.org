<b>Brain Injury Knowledge Ontology (BIKO)</b>
</p>

- Welcome to the page for BIKO, a multi-species translational traumatic brain injury ontology to assist in formalizing concepts and methods used in traumatic brain injury research. BIKO creates a standardized model to describe methods and outcome measures used within preclinical and clinical TBI therapy studies to facilitate comparison across studies and models. 

- Currently, all papers in BIKObase have been retrieved from PubMed, so they all have an associated PubMed ID.
