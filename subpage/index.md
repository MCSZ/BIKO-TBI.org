<b>Brain Injury Knowledge Ontology (BIKO)</b>
</p>

Welcome to the page for BIKO, a multi-species translational traumatic brain injury ontology to assist in formalizing concepts and methods used in traumatic brain injury research. BIKO creates a standardized model to describe methods and outcome measures used within preclinical and clinical TBI therapy studies to facilitate comparison across studies and models. 

- The first version of BIKO focuses on modeling the major preclinical TBI models, e.g., Controlled Cortical Impact Model, Fluid Percussion Model, and Weight-Drop Model), major neurological injuries related to these models and their relationship to clinical pathophysiology. Releases are available on [Github](https://github.com/MCSZ/bikotbi.io/releases)
