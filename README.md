Brain Injury Knowledge Ontology for Traumatic Brain Injury

The Brain Injury Knowledge Ontology for traumatic brain injury (BIKO-TBI) is a project to uncover similarities and differences within and between preclinical and clinical translational traumatic brain injury (TBI) studies.

- **BIKO** - the brain injury knowledge ontology - is an ontology for translation TBI studies. BIKO provides the schema for BIKObase, BIKOnet, and potentially other studies to computationally investigate TBI studies. 

- **BIKObase** - the brain injury knowledge ontology knowledge base - is a knowledge base for translation TBI studies. BIKObase is a repository of translational TBI scientific articles queryable by TBI, species, and methods used in these studies. 

- **BIKOnet** - the brain injury knowledge ontology network analysis - is a network analysis tool for translating TBI studies. BIKOnet is a queryable visual tool that examines the relationship between translational TBI scientific articles based on the metadata and the methods used in the study, such as type of injury, species, methods, and outcomes. 

**This project is ongoing, but tools and resources will be added to this page as they are developed.**
